# FractionX 💎  
### Democratizing High-Value Asset Investment via Fractionalization

🎯 **Track:** Best Innovation

## 🚀 Overview

**FractionX** is a next-generation fintech platform that democratizes access to high-value assets such as **luxury cars, commercial real estate, and fine art**.

Traditionally, these asset classes are limited to investors with ₹50,00,000+ capital. FractionX disrupts this model by **fractionalizing illiquid assets into micro-ownership units**, enabling investments starting from just **₹500**.

Our mission is to empower **students and first-time investors** with access to wealth creation opportunities previously reserved for the elite.

## 🧠 Challenges & Learnings

### 🚧 Challenges We Faced
* **Deployment "Path Hell":** Our biggest hurdle was moving from Localhost to Production. Render kept crashing with `Cannot find module server.js` because of our nested folder structure (`Backend/Backend/...`).
    * **Fix:** We learned to configure the **Root Directory** and **Start Command** explicitly in the cloud dashboard, decoupling the build process from the folder structure.

* **The "Cold Start" Latency:** Since we are using free-tier hosting, the backend "sleeps" after inactivity. This caused the Frontend to hang on "Loading..." indefinitely for new users.
    * **Fix:** We implemented a **Hybrid Data Strategy**. We now fetch data from `localStorage` first (for instant rendering) and sync with the Backend in the background.

* **CORS & Security Policies:** Connecting a standalone Frontend to a separate Backend server triggered multiple CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors.
    * **Fix:** We configured the Express middleware to whitelist specific origins, ensuring secure but functional communication between client and server.

### 💡 Key Learnings
1.  **Production vs. Development:** "It works on my machine" is not enough. We learned how to debug remote server logs and handle environment variables securely.
2.  **Fail-Safe UI Design:** Always assume the API might fail. We built robust error handling and "Mock Data" fallbacks so the user never sees a broken screen.
3.  **State Management:** We learned the importance of a "Single Source of Truth" for global variables (like API URLs) to prevent script conflicts across different HTML pages.
